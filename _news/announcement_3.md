🚨 Publication Alert 🚨
My second paper just got published in Social Science & Medicine together with Maarten Bijlsma, Frank van Lenthe and Mikko Myrskylä,
we looked at the role of  labor market inequalities in explaining the gender depression gap among older US adults.
Go check out our paper! 🤗🤗🤗
We also provide the R code for reproducing the analysis 👩‍💻
