Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Center for Artifical Intelligence in Public Health Research of the Robert Koch Institute] (https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/ZKI-PH/ZKI-PH_node.html). 
Being part of the [Climate and Societal Analysis ](https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/ZKI-PH/ZKI-PH4/ZKI-PH4_node.html), I am combining my interest in causal inference with machine learning and AI. 
I will continue my work on mental health and health inequalities with a focus on the consequences of climate change. 

I hold a PhD in Public Health from the Erasmus University Rotterdam. My PhD research was conducted at the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/de), in affilitation with the [Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/pages/about-erasmusmc).
The topic of my dissertation was to explore mechanisms underlying subgroup variation in mental health through the use of the counterfactual outcomes framework and genetically informed designs.
