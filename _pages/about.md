Hi! I am a PhD Student at the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en) and am affiliated with the [Public Health Department](https://www.publichealthrotterdam.com/). I am interested in all things mental health and causal inference!\
\
In my dissertation, I am using causal decomposition methods to study mental health and its determinants, with a focus on trying to explain differences across subgroups, e.g. birth cohorts, gender or socioeconomic status.
